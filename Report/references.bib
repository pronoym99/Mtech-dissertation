abstract = {Video summarization is a method to reduce redundancy and generate succinct representation of the video data. One of the mechanisms to generate video summaries is to extract key frames which represent the most important content of the video. In this paper, a new technique for key frame extraction is presented. The scheme uses an aggregation mechanism to combine the visual features extracted from the correlation of RGB color channels, color histogram, and moments of inertia to extract key frames from the video. An adaptive formula is then used to combine the results of the current iteration with those from the previous. The use of the adaptive formula generates a smooth output function and also reduces redundancy. The results are compared to some of the other techniques based on objective criteria. The experimental results show that the proposed technique generates summaries that are closer to the summaries created by humans.}
